# MiniDetector

This repository contains the MiniDetector system, designed for detecting consistency issues within Mini-Apps. It provides tools for analyzing data flow, extracting entities from privacy policies, and conducting consistency detection.

## Structure

* `data`
  * `groundtruth`: contains the groundtruth of our approach, including 70 mini-apps (data flow and privacy policy). Due to the size restriction of the GitHub repo, only 5 samples are included. For more samples, please download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J0bUYwh6puWTtIAEi8423QWLfyMw1Y4U/view?usp=sharing).
  * `policies`: contains 100 privacy policies from 50 popular apps (both Android and mini-apps).

* `ontology`: includes two ontologies, covering data types and operations.
* `flow`: analyzes data flow. This tool performs taint analysis for data flow in WeChat mini-apps.
* `entity`: entity extraction in privacy policies. 
  - `llm.py`: retrieves practical entities from privacy policies.
  - `extract.py`: extracts privacy policies from static program code.
* `consistency`: consistency detection module.
  

## How to Use

1. Use `flow` to obtain data flow results.  The entry file is `main.js`. Modify the incoming mini-app file directory as needed. After the analysis is completed, a `__res__` result file will be generated in the directory.

2. Use `entity` to extract data practices from privacy policies.
3. Utilize `consistency` for consistency detection.

## Environment

* `Node.js 12.19.0`
* `esprima`
* `Python 3.6.13`
